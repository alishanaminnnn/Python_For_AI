This repository is my personal journey of learning Python programming. I post the code I practice every day, covering:
ðŸ”¹ Basics: variables, data types, operators
ðŸ”¹ Control flow: if/else, loops
ðŸ”¹ Functions & logic building
ðŸ”¹ Strings, lists, dictionaries
ðŸ”¹ Beginner projects & problem-solving

The goal is to build strong programming logic step by step and track my growth in Python.
